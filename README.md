# What is this page about : 

Brutalist architecture is a site where you can find a list of buildings in Ireland built in a style popular in the 1960s and 1970s called brutalism. Raw concrete constructions loved by some and hated by others. On the website you can find out what brutalism is, find brutalist architecture on the map of Ireland and see a photo of the most interesting such buildings in Dublin. Visitors will also be able to sign up for photo workshops and learn how to properly make a photo of architecture, not necessarily brutalist.

# Design : 

As the project mainly includes black and white photos, the orange color was chosen as a strong contrast to gray. Matching color palette was generated at www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/ In addition to orange, dark blue and smoke white were also used as the fill colors for most text blocks.
The font was also chosen not by accident. Elegant sans serif Fjalla One font used for headlines and Merriweather Sans for paragraphs.

## Home page image slider:

However, the user cannot manually choose the order in which the photos are presented. Photos are displayed in a loop. After presenting the last, the slider returns to the first position.

## What is brutalism section:

This part of the page, divided into six columns, introduces the user to the definition of an architectural style called brutalism. In the center there is also a graphic matching the website design with a very characteristic building - water tower on the campus of the University City of Dublin. The page section is fully scalable and is displayed on mobile devices as one column - one block of text.

## A subjective choice of brutalist architecture in Europe:

In this part, the designer of the site chose, in his opinion, the most characteristic buildings of the brutalist style in Europe. The section consists of 5 black and white photos. The photo changes to color when user move cursor over it. The designer idea  was that the first photo should show the general shape / block of the building and the second, colored one, focuses on characteristic detail of a given structure. Below the photo there is the name of the building, its location and the "Discover more" button. The button opens the Wikipedia page (or other available source) where the user can learn more about the structure.

## Author's Google Map with the location of known or less known brutalist buildings in Ireland:

This part shows a map of Ireland with the location of known brutalist buildings. Map created by the website designer in the Google My Maps tool (www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps). The design of the map and its colors have been matched to the design of the website as much as the customization tools provided by Google allow it. The choice of buildings is suggestive and based solely on the knowledge of the designer and is certainly not complete. The designer would like to expand the functionality of this map in the future so that the user can add new buildings to the list.
