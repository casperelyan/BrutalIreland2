        <div class="header-flex_left">Why is Brutalism called Brutalism?</div>
        <p>The term originates from the use, by the pioneer modern architect and 
            painter Le Corbusier, of 'beton brut' – raw concrete in French. 
            Banham gave the French word a punning twist to express the general horror with which 
            this concrete architecture was greeted in Britain
            <div class="header-flex_left">The Origins of Brutalism:</div>
            <p>Brutalism emerged after the Second World War but was rooted in the ideas 
                of functionalism and monumental simplicity that had defined earlier architectural modernism, 
                including the International Style. Brutalism sought to adapt earlier principles to a post-war 
                world where urban reconstruction was a pressing necessity</p></div>

    <div class="flex-item-right">
        <div class="header-flex_right">Characteristic of Brutalism:</div>
        <p>Brutalism was generally characterised by its rough, unfinished surfaces, 
            unusual shapes, heavy-looking materials, straight lines, and small windows. 
            Modular elements were often used to form masses representing specific 
            functional zones, grouped into a unified whole</p>
            <div class="header-flex_right">Is brutalism part of modernism?</div>
            <p>Like International style, Brutalism is sometimes classified as its own distinctive subtype, 
                though it is considered a variant of post-war modernism. Despite its apparently appropriate 
                name, Brutalism is derived from the French term, beton brut, which translates to “rough concrete”</p>
